Card Validation System

This project is a card validation system implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a user-friendly interface for validating credit card numbers entered by users and determining their validity.

Features:

User-friendly interface: The project offers a visually appealing and intuitive interface that allows users to enter credit card numbers for validation easily.
Real-time validation: The system validates the credit card number in real-time as the user types, providing immediate feedback on the validity of the card.
Card type identification: Based on the entered card number, the system can determine the type of card (Visa, Mastercard, American Express, etc.) and display the corresponding card logo or icon.
Error handling: The system includes robust error handling mechanisms to inform users about any input errors or invalid card numbers.
Luhn algorithm: The validation process utilizes the Luhn algorithm, a widely accepted method for verifying the integrity of credit card numbers.
Technologies used:

HTML: The project utilizes HTML to structure the web pages, define input fields, and display the validation results.
CSS: Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are used to enhance the visual appearance of the project, including layout, color schemes, and typography.
JavaScript: JavaScript is employed to implement the card validation logic, handle user interactions, and update the user interface dynamically.
Usage:

Enter the credit card number in the designated input field.
As you type, the system will validate the card number and provide real-time feedback.
The system will identify the card type and display the corresponding logo or icon.
If any errors occur or the card number is invalid, appropriate error messages will be displayed.
This project serves as a basic implementation of a card validation system, demonstrating the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive and responsive user interface. Feel free to explore the code and customize it to fit your specific needs.
